Rules
=====

The rules below are taken from the Wikipedia article "Yatzy"
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy; CC BY-SA 3.0) with minor changes.


Gameplay
--------

Yatzy can be played solitaire or by any number of players.  Rusty Yacht
currenty supports just the former.  Players take turns rolling five dice.
After each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll.
A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn.
The player must put a score or a dash into a score box each turn.  The game ends
when all score boxes are used.  The player with the highest total score wins
the game.


Scoring
-------

The following combinations earn points.

Upper Section
-------------

Name        Description
----------------------------------------------------
Ones        The sum of all dice showing the number 1
Twos        ---------------- * * ----------------- 2
Threes      ---------------- * * ----------------- 3
Fours       ---------------- * * ----------------- 4
Fives       ---------------- * * ----------------- 5
Sixes       ---------------- * * ----------------- 6

A score of at least 63 points (an average of three of each number) in the upper
section, awards a bonus of 50 points.


Lower Section
-------------

Name             Description                         Score
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One Pair         Two dice showing the same number    Sum of those two dice
Two Pairs        Two different pairs of dice         Sum of dice in those two pairs
Three of a Kind  Three dice showing the same number  Sum of those three dice
Four of a Kind   Four dice with the same number      Sum of those four dice
Small Straight   The combination 1-2-3-4-5           15 points (sum of all the dice)
Large Straight   The combination 2-3-4-5-6           20 points (sum of all the dice)
Full House       Any set of three combined
                 with a different pair               Sum of all the dice
Chance           Any combination of dice             Sum of all the dice
Yatzy            All five dice with the same number  50 points

Two Pairs and Full House must have different numbers so that e.g. the combination
1-5-5-6-6 will score 22 as Two Pairs, but 5-5-5-5-5 will score nothing in any
of those categories.

Some combinations offer the player a choice as to which category to score them
under.  A full house could be scored in the Full House, the Three of a Kind,
Two Pairs, One Pair or the Chance categories.  2-2-5-5-5 would thus score 19
in Full House or Chance, 15 in Three of a Kind, 14 in Two Pairs or 10
in One Pair.
